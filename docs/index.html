          Rhetoric is a counterpart<span class="sidenote-number"></label>
          <span class="sidenote">
            Not an exact copy, but making a kind of pair with it, and
            corresponding to it as the antistrophe to the strophe in a choral
            ode.

          of Dialectic; for both have to do with matters that are in a manner
          within the cognizance of all men and not confined

          <span class="sidenote">
            Or “and they (Rhetoric and Dialectic) are not confined.”

          to any special science. Hence all men in a manner have a share of
          both; for all, up to a certain point, endeavor to criticize or uphold
          an argument, to defend themselves or to accuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the majority of people do this either at random or with a
          familiarity arising from habit. But since both these ways are
          possible, it is clear that matters can be reduced to a system, for it
          is possible to examine the reason why some attain their end by
          familiarity and others by chance; and such an examination all would at
          once admit to be the function of an art.
          <label class="sidenote-number"></label>
          <span class="sidenote">
            The special characteristic of an art is the discovery of a system or
            method, as distinguished from mere knack (ἐμπειρία).

          Now, previous compilers of “Arts”
          <label class="sidenote-number"></label>
          <span class="sidenote">
            Manuals or handbooks treating of the rules of any art or science.
          </span>
          of Rhetoric have provided us with only a small portion of this art,
          for proofs are the only things in it that come within the province of
          art; everything else is merely an accessory. And yet they say nothing
          about enthymemes which are the body of proof, but chiefly devote their
          attention to matters outside the subject;
